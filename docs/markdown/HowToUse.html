<p>The idea behind this script is to display the list of all .md files of a specific folder and every subfolders.</p>
<p>The script is called <code>index.php</code> and just need to be put on a localhost website (refer to f.i. <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/">WAMP</a>/<a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> for learning how to create a local website)  </p>
<p>The output will look likes this : </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Just download the repository from GitHub here : <a href="https://github.com/cavo789/markdown"><a href="https://github.com/cavo789/markdown">https://github.com/cavo789/markdown</a></a><a href="https://github.com/cavo789/markdown">https://github.com/cavo789/markdown</a>.</p>
<p>Create a new localhost website (let's say <code>markdown</code>).</p>
<p>Uncompress the markdown.zip file to the &quot;markdown&quot; folder you've just created under your wwwroot.</p>
<p>In that folder, you'll file the <code>index.php</code> script, a <code>libs</code> folder and a <code>docs</code> one.  The <code>docs</code> folder is aimed to be the location of your markdown files.</p>
<h2>Folder &quot;docs&quot;</h2>
<p>By default, the <code>index.php</code> script will scan the <code>docs</code> folder.  You can change this in the very first line of the source.</p>
<p>You can too, without changing anything, just create a symbolic links called &quot;docs&quot; but pointing to the folder where, already today, you're saving your .md files.</p>
<h2>Taking notes</h2>
<p>Take a look on this <code>HowToUse.md</code> file : the syntax is the one of markdown (if you don't know this syntax, refer to the official GitHub guide : <a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf"><a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf">https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf</a></a>).</p>
<p>Note that there are a lot of editors, free or commercial, to make life easier. At writing time, I'm using <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad 2</a> for Windows.</p>
<p>So, take a look on this <code>HowToUse.md</code> file : the syntax is standard except that I'm using an html img tag to display images.  Unless you made changes to the PHP script, please respect this : refers to local images that are stored in a subfolder called &quot;images&quot;.  So, write your .md file in a folder (f.i. &quot;<code>howtos</code>&quot;) and, if you need images, create a subfolder (&quot;<code>howtos/images</code>&quot;) and put images there.   Just like you can see it here, in this file.</p>
<h2>Using the script</h2>
<p>So, you've create a localhost website and you've call it &quot;<code>markdown</code>&quot;.  To use the script, just start your local webserver and go to your <code>http://localhost/markdown</code> website.</p>
<p>If you've correctly configured your webserver and alias, you'll should see the interface.  Just after the installation of the script, you'll see something like this :</p>
<img src="images/howtouse.png" width="680"/>
<ul>
<li>In the left pane, you'll retrieve the list of .md files found in the /docs folder.</li>
<li>In the right pane, just after a click on a file, you'll get his HTML output (with image support).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Left pane</h3>
<p>The script will scan the /docs folder and will list every single .md files found there; in the root folder and in any subfolder.</p>
<p>The list will be displayed in a table : in the first column the folder structure and, in the second column, the name of the file.</p>
<p>By clicking onto the first column, you'll apply a filter : only files of that specific folder will be displayed.  You can also use the selection at the top of the first column.</p>
<p>By clicking on the second column, on a filename, that file will be displayed but not his markdown content but his html output, converted on the fly.  This conversion is done thanks the script <code>parsedown</code> of Emanuil Rusev (<a href="http://erusev.com"><a href="http://erusev.com">http://erusev.com</a></a>).</p>
<h3>Right pane</h3>
<p>By displaying the content, the script will automatically generate a .html file and store that file in the same folder of your .md file.</p>
<p>If you've modify something in your .md file, the .html file will be generated again (thanks to a md5 content comparaison).</p>
<p>The right pane use Bootstrap and contains jQuery lines of code for retrieving the first h1 of the .md content : that heading will be used to initialize the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the page.</p>
<p>That preview pane also provide a links &quot;Open in a new window&quot; : click on that link and a new tab will be created on your browser and will display the .html file (no more the .md file).   &quot;Open in a new window&quot; will refers to the local file and no more the <code>index.php</code> script.</p>
<h2>Print</h2>
<p>If you wish to print your document, you don't need to open the file in a new tab, just press CTRL-P or click on the printer icon : thanks to special css style (<code>@media print</code>), only the right page and only the content will be sent to the printer.</p>
<p>The list of files and hyperlinks won't be printed. </p>
