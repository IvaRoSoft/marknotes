## In a few words

During years, I've used Evernotes™ to manage my notes (documentation, user guide, ebooks, billing, ... i.e. everything I need to keep in one central place and being able to retrieve them easily).

In 2016, Evernote has introduced more restriction with the Free version and by the end of the year, has stated that somes employees will have access to **our** notes for administration tasks. 

Then I've say "No !" : no, even if the tool was easy and free, no, I didn't want to an human can get access to my knowledge base, I wish to be able to better manage who / when / why and, on top of this, somes features were missing for me : easily display notes as an HTML page, as a slideshow, convert them in f.i. a Word document, and so on. 

Marknotes is fully Open Source and is using just *stupid* text files (markdown ones). It's really easy to create files, edit them in any text editor, ... and due to the file format, the integration with any tools and existing process is easy.


## Documentation

You can find the previous documentation on the wiki here : [https://github.com/cavo789/marknotes/wiki](https://github.com/cavo789/marknotes/wiki)

This wiki should be rewritten due to a major architecture change : the core of marknotes has been rework and features have been isolated into many plugins that make maintenance easier. I hope to find time soon to rewrite the documentation.

Please also take time to read the "[Présentation du logiciel marknotes](https://www.marknotes.fr/docs/Presentation-de-marknotes#/presentation-du-logiciel-marknotes)" (in French but you can translate it easily in other language thanks to the marknotes Google Translate plugin (top left))

## Demo site

The demo is available on [https://www.marknotes.fr](https://www.marknotes.fr). Please take a look.

marknotes is available in French and in English. The configuration on the demo site is done for french speaking people.
