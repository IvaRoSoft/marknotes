<h3 id="click_hamburger">You don't see the list of files/folders</h3>

On small screen like smartphones, the left pane (aka the <code>treeview</code>) isn't displayed by default. To see it, just click on the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon that you can see in the header of the page. This icon will toggle the visibility of the <code>treeview</code>.

<h3 id="add_note">You wish to add a note</h3>

First time with marknotes and nothing to display ? In order to create a new note, you can do it directly on disk or by using the interface.

<h4>Directly on disk (on localhost)</h4>

Probably the most easy way when you're working on a localhost environment : just go to the folder <code>%DOCS%</code> and create any folder and files. The file's extension should be <code>.md</code> (<em>and not .markdown f.i.</em>).

Go back here and refresh the screen. If everything is fine, you'll see your added files / folders in the <code>treeview</code>. If you don't see them, clear the cache by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-eraser" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon (see in the top right of the screen).

<h4>By using the interface (online)</h4>

In the right side of the header, you'll see this icon : <i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i>. Click on it and when prompted, fill in the login and the password to make the connexion. By default, the login is <strong>admin</strong> and the password is <strong>marknotes</strong>.

You can of course change them later on by editing the <code>settings.json.dist</code> file.

Once connected, a visual tip that you're well connected is the new look of the icon : no more <i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i> <em>(going inside)</em> but well <i class="fa fa-sign-out" aria-hidden="true"></i> <em>(leaving)</em>.

In the <code>treeview</code> right-clic on an existing folder (by default called <code>docs</code>). You'll get a popup menu with at least two new items : <code>Create a new folder</code> and <code>Create a new note</code>.

Click on <code>Create a new note</code> to go into the editor window, type your note and save it and quit the editor. The note will be then displayed and saved on disk (in the <code>%DOCS%</code> folder).
