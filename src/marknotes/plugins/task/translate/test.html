##  Joomla?s Response to Overturning Net Neutrality in the United States 

New York - December 15, 2017The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) vote on Thursday December 14, 2017 to repeal [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality), while unfortunately expected, is tremendously disappointing to all believers of an open and free internet.Open Source Matters, Inc. and the Joomla Community believe wholeheartedly in content creation and dissemination. We as a community have been overwhelmingly in favor of retaining Net Neutrality in the United States and worldwide and will seek to make our voices heard in as many ways as possible.

We encourage individual participation in all public outlets to promote Net Neutrality and combat the shrinking of the internet for only the few who can pay to deliver content. We should not limit ourselves to social media activism, we must call, mail letters, and visit our elected officials to directly relay our displeasure, to ask for accountability, and demand reinstatement of Net Neutrality.

Second, please support the dissenting FCC members, regardless of partisan politics, they had the courage to see and fight for an open internet, and we should use our voices to help them as they fight the day to day battle. Please read their statements: ?

Last, this fight is not over. We individually and as a community have been working with and will continue to work with organizations, political action committees ([PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee)), and individuals who support an open internet as much as we do. While the process may be arduous and complex, we who have built our professional and personal lives upon an open internet owe it to ourselves, our neighbors, and future generations to preserve one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century.

We are not discouraged. We are stronger. And today we are a part of the caretakers of the internet bringing our voices to the masses.
